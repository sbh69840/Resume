From the past two years, I have been pondering about how human brain works, the more I thought, the more I started going back to the history of how it all started to represent a human brain mathematically. Which led me to a book by Donald O Hebb and most of the work being done during that time. Deep inside I felt maybe we started wrong. I might be wrong, and hence I want to be exposed to the latest findings by interning at DeepMind.
